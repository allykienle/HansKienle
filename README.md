# HansKienle
I want to keep everything created by my beloved husband, Hans Kienle, who passed away in a sudden. I love you and I miss you.
Drawing and designs and poems, you are creative and optimistic
But I am dumm and negtive
How can I live along in the cold Germany?
Our dog, does not see the change of my life. But she misses you for sure.
Why you never come back to my dreams? Or you already in a heaven and happily with your ex girls?
That is not a very funny posibility that I should think about.
